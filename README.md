# flutter_starter_app

Flutter starter project (i.e the counter app) redone using MVVM architecture as proposed by FilledStacks. Added some updates off my own. 
Update(Oct 2022): Use Injectable to register dependencies instead of  separate locator file; build using this command: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
